  <p class="text-white text-center mb-4">
    Already planning next year. This time we're scheduling it so it <strong>won't conflict</strong> with Whorewhole 3 or any other ingroup/tpot events, which means way more people can come.
  </p>

  <p class="text-white text-center mb-4">
    2027 is going to be a <strong>real tpot camp</strong>: less pirate-radio, more actual organization. Ticketing and planning will start much earlier, some time in spring 2026.
  </p>

  <p class="text-purple-300 text-center">
    Stay tuned.
